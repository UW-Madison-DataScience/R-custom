## Prerequisites and Setup

- Download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?user_email=&source=form-home-signup)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- This workshop is aimed at people who have some knowledge of R and RStudio, but you don't have to be an expert.

## Motivation

## Setup: Summer Project
- create local folder
- create analysis script, just comments, no code.
- [generating key and adding it to the ssh agent](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) [adding new ssh key to gh account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

## Working locally with Git
- stage and commit
- changes, stage, commit again
- git log
- checkout of some sort (is there a way to do this interactively?)
- gitignore (use the interactive gui)

## Connecting to GitHub
- Kaija will do some digging to look at setting up GitHub secondarily--if it's complicated, we'll just do it first. 
- push/pull

## Basic branching and merging
- making a new branch
- local vs. remote branch

## Dealing with merge conflicts
- make same change on same line to two different branches
