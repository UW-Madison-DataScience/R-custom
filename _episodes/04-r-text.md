## Openrefine outline

- Faceting -> factors in forcats, or dplyr::distinct
- Clustering - there are ways to do this in R, but i’ve taught it before andit’s pretty confusing. Maybe show them how to recode with forcats instead?
- Split - tidyr::separate
- Trim whitespace stringr:str_trim
- Filtering - do we need to repeat this from dplyr?
- Sorting - dplyr::arrange
- Numbers + numeric facets - not sure this makes sense either
- Scripts - already covered
- Saving - maybe reiterate write_csv
